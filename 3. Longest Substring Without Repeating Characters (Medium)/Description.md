Given a string `s`, find the length of the **longest substring** without repeating characters.

 

#### Example 1:

<pre>
<code>
<b>Input: s = "abcabcbb"</b>
<b>Output: 3</b>
<b>Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.</b>
</code>
</pre>

#### Example 2:

<pre>
<code>
<b>Input: s = "bbbbb"</b>
<b>Output: 1</b>
<b>Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.</b>
</code>
</pre>

#### Example 3:

<pre>
<code>
<b>Input: s = "pwwkew"</b>
<b>Output: 3</b>
<b>Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.</b>
Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
</code>
</pre>
 

Constraints:

- `0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
- `s` consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.
